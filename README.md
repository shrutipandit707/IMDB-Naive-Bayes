## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using Naive Bayes Technique for IMDB Review Classification

- What is the background of your project?

In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Naive Bayes techniques. based on Naive Bayes classifier to predict positive and negative reviews from IMDB dataset.


- Business Problem Statement:

In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Naive Bayes techniques. based on Naive Bayes classifier to predict positive and negative reviews from IMDB dataset.


- What is the dataset that is being used?

The data given to us contains the information about Positive and Negative reviews of movies from IMDB.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- In this notebok, we learnt what is a Naive Bayes classifier and how to build it from scratch. You can now use the classifier to predict the label for unseen movie reviews not present in the dataset. Note that there are readymade Naive Bayes models available in the scikit-learn library which we can use in our work instead of building models from scratch. There are 5 types of Naive Bayes classifiers available in scikit-learn â€“ namely Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Categorical NB, Complement NB, Gaussian NB, and Multinomial NB.
